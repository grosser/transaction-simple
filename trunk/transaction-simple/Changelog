== Transaction::Simple 1.11
* Cleaned up some documentation.

== Transaction::Simple 1.1
* Added Transaction::Simple::ThreadSafe for truly atomic and thread-safe
  transactions.
* Fixed the description of Transaction::Simple to note that it is *not* atomic
  because it is not necessarily thread-safe.
* Added support for named transactions. Named transactions can be used to make
  checkpoints that can be committed, aborted, or rewound without explicitly
  committing, aborting, or rewinding the intervening transactions.

== Transaction::Simple 1.0
* Created. Initial release.
